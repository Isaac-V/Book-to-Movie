Abstract from associated research paper located in the Documents directory:
"Film adaptation from literature is a complex process that would benefit greatly if its success could be estimated before the adaptation is attempted. In this study an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is used to predict the success of a film adaptation by observing data about the work of literature it is based on. This ANN uses the popularity and subject matter of a work of literature to not only predict the financial success of its film adaptation, but also the artistic success as determined by its audience ratings and award nominations. To accomplish this, the data from hundreds of books and their film adaptations will be gathered and used to train an ANN by supervised learning and the Backpropagation Algorithm. The ANN will then associate certain literature popularity and subject matter characteristics with successful film adaptations. The results of this study show a strong relationship between the success of a film adaptation and the popularity and subject matter of the book it was based upon."
