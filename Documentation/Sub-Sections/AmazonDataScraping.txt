Book data was gathered from Amazon via web scraping. The data that needed to be acquired included bestseller, rating, review count, age group, and keyword information. Unfortunately the Amazon AWS API doesn't provide that information so a custom Java webscrapers had to be designed to acquire this data, see the AmazonScraper source file in the attached code documents.

The AmazonScraper Java webscraper was designed to find the associated data for every book title that was given to it. To accomplish this, it reads the BookToMovieIndex file one line at a time and parses the book title into a string. This string is then used to create an Amazon book search URL. Upon establishing a connection to this URL, the html source lines are pulled and the URL from the first search result is parsed out and used to establish a connection to the Amazon book webpage associated with the original book title. The AmazonScraper then uses String pattern matching to parse relevent data out of html source of the Amazon book webpage and writes it out to a file. This technique is was used for every book title in the BookToMovieIndex.

Once all the book data had been scraped from Amazon, it was then filtered. Books that had no bestseller, rating, and review information were removed because that indicated that the book title either had no search results, or no reviews on its Amazon book webpage. It was decided that if a book possessed no review or rating information, it would just confuse our data and not help in training our ANN. The resulting filtered book data file was then compared to the filtered movie data file to eliminate any books and movies that were present in one list, but not the other. The resulting list of 505 books, movies, and associated data from this final comparison was ultimately used for all ANN supervised training conducted during this project.
